## Developing/Contributing

1. Clone the repo and install NPM packages
2. Run `npm run start:chrome` to start Parcel. It will automatically rebuild when you change a file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`, and ensure Developer Mode is enabled. Click Load Unpacked and choose the `dist/chrome` directory

If you would like to preview a production build, run `npm run build` and follow the same process to load the unpacked extension
